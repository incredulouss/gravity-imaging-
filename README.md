# gravity-imaging-
this project is based on computer vision and physics engine pixels rendering.
the main object of the project is to use the web cam to detect a specific colour and then use that location of pixel to make the sun(the object which attract).
the sun object is the attractor and it attracts the planet objects which revolve around the sun through gravitional force of attraction(physics engine in world of pixels).
This Application can be used in photography industry to create creative arts just by changing some code.
