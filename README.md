# gravity-imaging-
this project is based on computer vision and physics engine.
the main object of the project is to use the web cam to detect a specific colour and then use that location of pixel to make the sun(the object which attract).
the sun object is the attractor and it attracts the planet objects which revolve around the sun through gravitional force of attraction(physics engine in world of pixels).
we can increase the garvitational constant (force of attraction ) by increasing the value of c variable in blob detection gravity class.
we can constrain the distance of sun and planets in attractor class in fuction attract (r varible value of 5 and 25 could be manupilated).
This Application can be used in photography industry to create creative arts just by changing some code.
This could be a future of advertisment by big companies . I am working on a prototype with microsoft kinect for this purpose to set up a company for advertisement in which the customers will be able to interact with the advertisement made by the fasion and different companies
